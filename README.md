# llm-wiki-memory-template

A template repository for the [llm-wiki pattern](https://github.com/tobi/llm-wiki), with optional overlays for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/). The llm-wiki layer is agent-agnostic, so the same template also works in minimal mode for OpenCode, Pi, OpenInterpreter, or any agent you write yourself.

The pattern this template implements is described in [Beyond Memory](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21213175) (Saboia Moreira et al., 2026, Zenodo concept DOI that resolves to the latest version), with a project-facing overview at the [Wiki-Grounded Research Agent](https://la3d.github.io/WGRA) flyer.

## Status

**Only the Claude Code path has been validated end-to-end.** The slash commands `/wiki-experiment`, `/wiki-source`, `/wiki-lint`, the proactive read/write/commit loop, and the auto-commit step have all been exercised on a project derived from this template. The Claude Code overlay is ready for CRC use.

**Every other path is shipped but unvalidated in a live session.** That includes:

- The **Cursor overlay** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `wiki/agents/cursor/setup.sh`). The `.mdc` rule format, `@`-mention invocation, and `alwaysApply` semantics here are derived from Cursor's published documentation, not from observed behavior in a running Cursor IDE.
- The **minimal mode** (`--agent=none`). The wiki bootstrap works mechanically, but the proactive behavior depends on whatever agent you bring (OpenCode, Pi, OpenInterpreter, your own) discovering the wiki tooling on its own. No specific non-Claude-Code agent has been verified yet.

**If you are the first to try any of these paths, please [open an issue](https://github.com/crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template/issues/new) reporting:**

- Which agent and which version (e.g. *Cursor 0.42*, *OpenCode build XYZ*, *Pi*)
- Whether the agent picks up the configuration files this template installed (slash commands, rules)
- Whether the read/write/commit loop is honored
- Anything that does not match the walkthrough in the respective overlay README

Honest reports of failures are at least as useful as confirmations. The non-Claude-Code paths are hypotheses until someone runs them.

## 1. What this template gives you

- **A persistent, LLM-maintained wiki** as durable project memory (Query / Ingest / Lint operations). The wiki is its own git repository, separate from the project repo.
- **Repo-level agent rules** (`.claude/rules/*.md` for Claude Code, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for Cursor) codifying the read-to-recall / write-to-remember behavior. Your project's `CLAUDE.md` stays entirely yours; the template never creates or edits it.
- **Optional agent overlays** under `wiki/agents/<agent>/` that add slash commands, rules, settings, and personal memory seeds for a specific assistant. Today the template ships overlays for Claude Code and Cursor. Adding a new one (OpenCode, Pi, your own) follows a documented pattern.
- **Update tooling** so that projects instantiated from this template can pull in template improvements later without overwriting their own content.

## 2. Create a new project from this template

On GitHub, click **"Use this template" → "Create a new repository"**, choose a name (e.g. `data-platform-notes`), then clone the new repo locally. The next step depends on whether you want the wiki published as the project's GitHub Wiki or kept local-only.

### Path A: GitHub Wiki backend (recommended for sharing)

Use this path if the wiki should be browsable at `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/wiki` and pushable as a separate git remote. There is **one mandatory one-time UI step** before running `instantiate.sh`:

1. **Activate the GitHub Wiki** for the new repo (one-time):
   - Open `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/wiki` in a browser.
   - Click **"Create the first page"**.
   - Title: `Home`. Content: anything (this seed page is overwritten by `init-wiki.sh`). Save.

   *Why this is necessary:* GitHub creates `<repo>.wiki.git` lazily — it does not exist as a clonable/pushable git repo until the first page is created through the UI. Until then, every clone or push returns 404 *Repository not found*. This is GitHub's architecture; no API call, gh command, or git push can substitute for the UI click. **`instantiate.sh` will tell you to do this if you skip it**, but it costs less to do it now.

2. **Run instantiate** (one-time, the script self-deletes at the end):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/instantiate.sh "My Project Name" --agent=claude-code --github-wiki
   ```

   Other agent options: `--agent=cursor`, `--agent=all`, `--agent=none`.

3. **Commit and push** the generated files:

   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "chore: instantiate from llm-wiki-memory-template"
   git push origin main
   git -C wiki/<repo-name>.wiki push -u origin master    # publish wiki seed pages
   ```

### Path B: local-only wiki (no UI step required)

Use this path if you don't intend to publish the wiki, or you want to skip the one-time UI step:

```bash
./scripts/instantiate.sh "My Project Name" --agent=claude-code
# (no --github-wiki flag)
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: instantiate from llm-wiki-memory-template"
git push origin main
```

The wiki lives inside the project at `wiki/<repo-name>.wiki/` as a separate git repo with no remote. You can attach a remote and switch to Path B later (see `wiki/agents/README.md` for the procedure).

### Path C: template-contributor dev self-instance

Use this path **only** if you are developing on the template itself and want Claude Code to function as an llm-wiki instance against the template's own GitHub Wiki — i.e., to dogfood the pattern while working on it. The motivation and the recursive-bootstrap finding it addresses are documented at [Lessons-Learned-From-model_fusion § The recursive bootstrap problem](https://github.com/crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template/wiki/Lessons-Learned-From-model_fusion#the-recursive-bootstrap-problem).

Two commands, both run from a fresh clone of this template:

```bash
# 1. Clone the template's own GitHub Wiki manually (one-time).
git clone https://github.com/crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template.wiki.git \
  wiki/llm-wiki-memory-template.wiki

# 2. Install the SessionStart + PostToolUse hooks.
./scripts/instantiate.sh --dev-self
```

After this, Claude Code opened in the template clone has:
- The tracked `.claude/rules/*.md` files (live in every checkout) codifying the wiki-as-memory behavior.
- A `SessionStart` hook injecting the wiki reminder at every session start.
- A `PostToolUse` hook nudging the verification-gate workflow on every wiki write.

**All three artifacts** (`wiki/llm-wiki-memory-template.wiki/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/`) **are excluded locally** via `.git/info/exclude`, which `--dev-self` writes (and re-writes idempotently on re-runs). The exclusion is deliberately not in the tracked `.gitignore`: leading-slash anchors there would resolve to a derived project's own root after `update-from-template.sh` synced the file, shadowing that project's real `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/`. The artifacts are local-only by construction: never committed, never propagated to derived projects (which generate their own equivalents via Paths A or B). `--dev-self` does not call `init-wiki.sh`, does not modify `.claude/skills/`, and does not self-delete.

#### Updating after a template-side hook change

The hook scripts at `.claude/hooks/*.sh` are *snapshots* taken from `wiki/agents/claude-code/templates/` when `--dev-self` first installed them. `setup.sh` defensively refuses to overwrite a live hook that already exists (correct for derived projects where a user might have hand-customized their hook; not what a dev-self contributor wants). So after a PR lands that modifies a hook template, `git pull` updates the source-of-truth but your live hooks stay stale.

To force-refresh the live hooks against the latest template source:

```bash
git pull origin main
rm -f .claude/hooks/*.sh
./wiki/agents/claude-code/setup.sh --hook --posttooluse-hook
```

The `rm -f` is what makes `setup.sh` re-install rather than skip. `.claude/settings.json` is unaffected — `setup.sh` always re-asserts the hook registrations there idempotently via `jq`.

### What `instantiate.sh` does (either path)

1. Substitutes placeholders in `README.md.template` (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{REPO_NAME}}`, `{{OWNER}}`, `{{DESCRIPTION}}`) and writes `README.md`. It does NOT create a `CLAUDE.md`; that file is yours to write (the behavioral instructions ship as `.claude/rules/` and `.cursor/rules/` files instead).
2. Runs `wiki/init-wiki.sh` to bootstrap the wiki sub-repository at `wiki/<repo-name>.wiki/`. With `--github-wiki`, this clones the GitHub Wiki; without, it inits a local-only repo.
3. Substitutes `{{REPO_NAME}}` in shipped `.claude/skills/wiki-*/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, and `.claude/settings.json.template` files; renames `.claude/settings.json.template` to `.claude/settings.json`.
4. Runs the chosen overlay's `setup.sh` (Claude Code, Cursor, or both). Deletes the unused overlay directories so the project ships only what it uses.
5. **Self-deletes** at the end of a successful run. `instantiate.sh` is a one-shot bootstrap script; after a project is instantiated, the file does not exist in it.

If you pick `--agent=none`, only steps 1–2 (and the self-delete) run. The minimal install leaves `wiki/agents/` populated but inert; you can later add a custom agent overlay following the pattern documented in `wiki/agents/README.md`.

## 3. Adopt the pattern into an existing project

For repos that **already exist** and were **not** instantiated from this template (e.g. an established research project that now wants the wiki-as-memory discipline), use `scripts/adopt.sh` instead of `instantiate.sh`. Adopt is additive: it copies the template's shared infrastructure into your repo, never overwrites your own files, and uses a host-owned grants file to authorize the one integration touchpoint (the SessionStart hook entry in `.claude/settings.json`). The standard grant is applied by default; commit a `.llm-wiki-adopt-grants.yml` to customize. Everything else arrives as added files (`wiki/.gitignore` for the wiki ignore rule, `.claude/rules/*.md` for the behavioral instructions); your `CLAUDE.md` and root `.gitignore` are never touched.

The common flow, mirroring Path A of section 2 but for an existing repo:

```bash
gh repo clone <owner>/<project> && cd <project>
git clone https://github.com/crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template.git ~/src/llm-wiki-memory-template   # one-time per machine
bash ~/src/llm-wiki-memory-template/scripts/adopt.sh --target=. --apply --agent=claude-code --github-wiki
```

`--github-wiki` automates the same four manual github.com steps that Path A of section 2 covers (enable Wikis, seed the first page, wire the wiki remote, push). When the GitHub Wiki architecture quirk forces a 404 on the seed push, adopt logs `github-wiki: failed (seed-push 404; ...)` to `.llm-wiki-adopt-log.md`, prints the workaround on stderr, and falls back to a local-only wiki. Re-run with `--github-wiki` after the manual UI step to complete the migration.

If you adopt multiple projects from the same machine, an alias keeps the invocation short — no need for a separate `gh` extension:

```bash
alias adopt='bash ~/src/llm-wiki-memory-template/scripts/adopt.sh --target=.'
# Then: cd <project> && adopt --apply --github-wiki
```

Adopt is designed for first-time adoption only. Re-running it on a host that already shows the pattern (2 of 3 composite signals matched) advisory-aborts and routes you to `scripts/update-from-template.sh` (section 4) for ongoing sync.

## 4. Pull updates from this template into an existing project

The llm-wiki pattern, the agent overlays, the slash commands and rules, and the instantiate/update scripts evolve in this template. Once you have created a project from the template, run this **periodically** to pull improvements without overwriting your own narrative:

```bash
./scripts/update-from-template.sh --dry-run    # preview what would change
./scripts/update-from-template.sh              # apply changes
```

**What it updates** (generic, shared content; the authoritative list is `TEMPLATE_SHARED_INFRA` + the overlay arrays in `scripts/lib/template-manifest.sh`):

- `llm-wiki.md`, `wiki/init-wiki.sh`
- `wiki/agents/<agent>/setup.sh` and `wiki/agents/<agent>/templates/*` for every overlay present in the project
- `.claude/rules/wiki-as-memory.md`, `.claude/rules/memory-boundary.md`, `.claude/skills/wiki-*/SKILL.md` (only if `.claude/` exists in the project)
- `.cursor/rules/wiki-*.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/memory-boundary.mdc` (only if `.cursor/` exists in the project)
- `scripts/update-from-template.sh`, `scripts/check-template-version.sh` (`scripts/instantiate.sh` is one-shot and intentionally absent from derived projects, so it is never synced)

**What it does NOT touch** (project-specific content):

- `CLAUDE.md` (your project's narrative)
- `.gitignore` (host-owned and never modified; the post-sync report prints an advisory when it diverges from the template's, so you can back-port new ignore rules manually. The wiki sub-repo ignore rule ships as `wiki/.gitignore`, a synced template file)
- `README.md` (your project's user-facing docs)
- `.claude/settings.json` (your project's permissions)
- `.claude/hooks/` (per-machine hooks installed by `setup.sh --hook`)
- The wiki itself at `wiki/<your-repo>.wiki/` (separate git repo with its own history)
- Anything under your project source tree

After each run, an entry is appended to `.llm-wiki-template-log.md` (e.g. `## [2026-MM-DD] pulled template @<sha> -- N files updated`) so the sync history stays in the repo.

To check drift without making any changes:

```bash
./scripts/check-template-version.sh
```

### Migrating hosts adopted before the manifest shipped itself (#74)

Repos adopted before `scripts/lib/template-manifest.sh` entered the sync
manifest have an updater that dies at its `source lib/template-manifest.sh`
line — before the fetch that could deliver its own fix. The migration
therefore comes from OUTSIDE the host: re-run adopt from a current template
clone (additive; ADD never overwrites host files):

```bash
bash ~/src/llm-wiki-memory-template/scripts/adopt.sh --target=. --apply --force
```

`--force` bypasses the already-adopted advisory. This lands the manifest
(and stamps any missing wiki template pages, e.g. `Edge-Types.md`). The
host's existing `./scripts/update-from-template.sh` — even a pre-#74 one —
then works again and syncs everything else, including replacing itself with
the current version.

## 6. The three wiki operations (Query / Ingest / Lint)

The wiki has three operations: read it (Query), write to it (Ingest), and health-check it (Lint). All three are codified in:

- The shipped rules (`.claude/rules/wiki-as-memory.md` for Claude Code, `.cursor/rules/wiki-as-memory.mdc` for Cursor)
- The agent overlays (`/wiki-experiment`, `/wiki-source`, `/wiki-lint` for Claude Code; equivalent rules for Cursor)
- The wiki's own `SCHEMA_<repo>.md` (the authoritative procedures)

See [llm-wiki.md](llm-wiki.md) for the underlying pattern and [wiki/agents/README.md](wiki/agents/README.md) for the overlay structure.

## 7. Adding a new agent overlay (OpenCode, Pi, your own)

Each agent overlay lives in `wiki/agents/<agent>/` and follows a small contract documented in [wiki/agents/README.md](wiki/agents/README.md). To add support for a new agent:

1. Copy `wiki/agents/claude-code/` to `wiki/agents/<your-agent>/` as a starting point.
2. Adjust `setup.sh` to install the agent's project-level configuration files (its equivalent of `.claude/skills/`).
3. Update `templates/` with the agent-appropriate phrasings (rule format, command format, etc.).
4. Open a PR against this template repo so other projects in the organization can pick it up.

## 8. Opt-in features

Some capabilities are useful in some projects and unwanted in others (a knowledge-graph pipeline, a Socratic tutor behavior overlay, an agent-memory tool). Rather than ship every capability on by default and ask projects to delete what they do not want, the template hosts them under `features/<name>/` as **opt-in features**.

Enable a feature at instantiation:

```bash
./scripts/instantiate.sh "My Project" --agent=claude-code --features=<name>
# multiple at once:
./scripts/instantiate.sh "My Project" --agent=claude-code --features=kg,socratic-tutor
```

Enable or remove later:

```bash
./scripts/enable-feature.sh <name>
./scripts/enable-feature.sh --list       # see what is available and what is on
./scripts/disable-feature.sh <name>      # symmetric removal
```

Each feature is self-contained under `features/<name>/`: a `feature.json` plus optional code, tests, CI workflow, and an agent rule file (installed at `.claude/rules/feature-<name>.md`). Installing copies these into the derived project; uninstalling removes them. The state lives in `.features-enabled` (plain text, one feature per line) at the project root.

Authoring a new feature is documented in [docs/adding-a-feature.md](docs/adding-a-feature.md). The architecture is RFC #13; Etapa 1 (this infrastructure) shipped in PR #17.

The template ships **no** real features yet. The shape and machinery are validated; the first real feature is the next milestone.

## 9. Contributing back

Improvements to the agent-agnostic parts (the llm-wiki pattern, `init-wiki.sh`, the schema, the scripts) are most valuable when they land here, in the template. Once merged, every project that runs `update-from-template.sh` will pick them up on the next sync.

For project-specific customizations, edit your project's `CLAUDE.md`, README, or settings -- those never propagate.

**Maintainer note: to add a template-synced file, edit `scripts/lib/template-manifest.sh` and nothing else.** That file is the single source of truth that `instantiate.sh`, `adopt.sh`, `update-from-template.sh`, and `check-template-version.sh` all consume. The unit fixture `scripts/test/tests/unit/manifest-shape/` enforces the cross-array invariants (every path exists in the tree, no double-ownership, every substitute entry contains `{{REPO_NAME}}`), and the smoke fixture `scripts/test/tests/smoke/manifest-convergence/` proves the three scripts produce convergent output.
